      <h2>Origin</h2>
      <p>Thor comes from Assgard and is the son of Odin. He’s got superhuman strength, can control lightning, and speaks like a medieval drama king .</p>

      <h2>Weapon</h2>
      <p>His hammer, Mjolnir, is legendary. Only the worthy can lift it (sorry Hulk). It flies, returns, and blasts lightning like it's nobody's business.</p>




      <h2>Why He Rocks </h2>
      <p>He's brave, powerful, hilarious (especially with his hammer jokes), and always fights for what's right — whether on Earth or across the Nine Realms.</p>
